#### a minimialist text editor for android
##### a learning exercise,

Has basic functionality
if opening a text file directly it will load the contents and the save button will overwrite the file. (without asking)

can share a document to it from the file browser and it will open display the text
can share some highlighted to text to it and it will open and display the text
i havent added the save code for these yet though

you have to manually give it write permissions in the android settings, as i havent got any dialogs to work yet

see comments if you wish to help :)
or issues if i have added some.
